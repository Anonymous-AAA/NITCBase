# Errors
1. select_from_table used instead of select_from_table_where
2. Six operators are given as  =, !=, >, >=, < >=  (>= is repeated)
3. Output given for primary has different values for primary key value which is usually ignored
4. Type num should be printed as float instead of integer in output
5. Make it clear to open the table before inserting values into it in XFS interface
