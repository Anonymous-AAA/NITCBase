# Doubts
1. The documentation only speaks about reseting the searchIndex for linear search not for bplustree search but resets both before call to search


# Errors made
1. Used leafblock.setHeader instead of getHeader.
2. Max number of entries in a node used instead of actual number of entries while looping in bplustree search
